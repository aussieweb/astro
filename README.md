Astro is a collection of five mobile-first navigation patterns. The "plus" version of each pattern includes an expand-and-collapse menu on small screens.

* Basic | Basic Plus. A centered navigation and logo.
* Basic Left | Basic Left Plus. A left-aligned navigation and logo.
* Navbar | Navbar Plus. An inline navigation and logo.
* Navbar Left | Navbar Left Plus. An inline navigation and logo with left-aligned navigation.
* Stacked | Stacked Plus. Stacked navigation and logo.
