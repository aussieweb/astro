# Astro
Astro is a collection of five mobile-first navigation patterns. It's style-light so you can easily modify it to fit your design.

Each pattern contains two small-screen variants:
1. A simple version.
2. A collapse-and-expand option toggled by a menu button.

Pick the one that best fits your project.

## How It Works
